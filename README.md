# Take That Note

The client wanted a note taking application that stored notes for them. It needed to have the ability to store each note in its own database as well as retreive and display those notes.

## Getting Started

This application can be used from the deployed website. For a closer look you can use express.js to see the server side of the application.

### Prerequisites
